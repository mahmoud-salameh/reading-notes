Bold & Italic:
By enclosing words in the tags we can make characters appear bold.

TEXT Summary:

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

__CSS__ allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

__CSS__ Associates Style rules with HTML elements 
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.
 A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

__CSS__ Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
 You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

 |Selector|Meaning|Example|
|---|----|----|
|Universal Selector|Applies to all elements in the document|* {} Targets all elements on the page|
|Class Selector|Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol|.note {} Targets any element whose class attribute has a value of note p.note {} Targets only <p> elements whose class attribute has a value of note|
| ID Selector|Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol|#introduction {} Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction|


*__INTRODUCING CSS Summary:__*


*  CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
*  CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## *__Chapter 2. BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS__*


*__BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS summery:__*

* A script is made up of a series of statements.
 Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions.
 For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
* xpressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
