 reminders to my self of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
 1. Criticism: I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done. As I mentioned at the beginning, I often judge my days based on my mood at the end.
 2. Success of others: For a long time, I was fiercely jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent. But, with the help of our culture of openness and honesty, I was able to understand how the work I do relates to the work of my peers, and how it all comes together to create something awesome.
 3. Challenges: When I’m faced with a challenging I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it.
