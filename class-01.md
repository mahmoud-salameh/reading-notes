## __Introduction__

__How the Web Works:__

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. 
order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site;
for example:
[google](http://google.com)
[bbc](http://bbc.co.uk.com)
[microsoft](http://microsoft.com.)
Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.
An IP address is a number
of up to 12 digits separated
by periods / full stops. Every
device connected to the web
has a unique IP address; it is
like the phone number for that
computer.

The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users.

The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.

## *__chapter 1.Structure__*
**HTML** Uses Elements
to Describe the Structure of Pages

Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

The opening < html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing < /html> tag is HTML code.
The < body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
< /body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.

The closing </ body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.

The closing </ html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

_**structure Summary:**_
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## *__chapter 8. Extra Markup__*

### __Escape Characters:__
There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. 

__Examples:__

|sign   |The code for it|
|-------|------------|
|Less-than sign| &lt ; or &#60 ;|
|Greater-than sign|&gt ; or &amp ;|
| Ampersand|&amp ; &#38 ;|
| Quotation mark |& ; or &#34 ;|
| Left single quote |&lsquo ;or &#8216 ; |
| Right double quotes |&rdquo ;or &#8221 ;|

__*EXTRA MARKUP Summary :*__
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the
<! -- and --> markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

* The < div> and < span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* < iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The < meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## *__chapter 17. HTML5 Layout__*


__*HTML5 LAYOUT Summary:*__

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure. 
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple < div> elements).
*  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

## *__chapter 18. PROCESS & Design__*

__*PROCESS & Design Summary*__ 


* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

*  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
