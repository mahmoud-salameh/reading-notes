## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. 
She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. 
Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. 
Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. 
Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. 
All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me. 
She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. 
So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.


Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. 
Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. ‘‘We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,’’ says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. ‘‘All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don’t even notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.’’

Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in [The Harvard Business Review last month](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload),found that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.

Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. 
Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. 
They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.


In late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. 
By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadn’t yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.

After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. 
Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. 
Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company’s websites or servers go down.

## Transforms

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. 
Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. 
All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. 
Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

## Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. 
Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. 
Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

## 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS

Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your users’ faces.

1. Fade in

Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change, for example on hover:

.fade
{
        opacity:0.5;
}
.fade:hover
{
        opacity:1;
}

2. Change color

.color:hover
{
        background:#53a7ea;
}

3. Grow & Shrink

Set your div’s class to “grow” and then add this code to your style block:

.grow:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(1.3);
        -ms-transform: scale(1.3);
        transform: scale(1.3);
}

4. Rotate elements

.rotate:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        -ms-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
}

5. Square to circle

Give your div the class “circle” and add this CSS to your styles:

.circle:hover
{
        border-radius:50%;
}


7. Swing


This animation simply moves the element left and right, now all we need to do is apply it:

.swing :hover
{
        -webkit-animation: swing 1s ease;
        animation: swing 1s ease;
        -webkit-animation-iteration-count: 1;
        animation-iteration-count: 1;
}

8. Inset border

Give your div the class “border” and add the following CSS to your styles:

.border:hover
{
        box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 25px #53a7ea;
}
