# Functional Programming 

## What is functional programming ?

__* Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data*__ 

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function ?

__* It is mean returns the same result if given the same arguments*__ 

## So how do we know if a function is pure or not ?  

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments.

* It does not cause any observable side effects.

## What are the benefits of a pure function ?

1. Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B.

2. Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D. 

## What is immutability ?

__* When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t.*__ 

## What is Referential transparency ?

__*pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency*__



## What is a module ?

__* module is just essentially another Javascript file*__


## What does the word ‘require’ do ?

__* It is required the other Javascript files*__

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in ?

__* required the module*__

## What do we have to do to make a module available ?

__* Exports the module*__
