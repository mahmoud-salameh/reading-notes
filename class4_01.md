# Pain vs. Suffering

__That price is pain, the pain of growth.__


**All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.**

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do. Research! Build your resources and your community! Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.

**It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. Live it, love it, and take it**

# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

**Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.**

__**As a programmer first and a mathematician second (or maybe third or fourth) I found the best way to understand Big O thoroughly was to produce some examples in code. So, below are some common orders of growth along with descriptions and examples where possible.**__

## __O(1)__

**O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.**

## __O(N)__


**O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.**


## __O(N²)__


**O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.**

## __O(2^N)__

**O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:**
