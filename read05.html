                    <h2>USING
                        COMPARISON OPERATORS </h2>

                    
                </p>
                At the most basic level, you can
                evaluate two variables using a
                comparison operator to return a
                 t rue or f al se value.
                In this example, a user is taking a
                test, and the script tells the user
                whether they have passed this
                round of the test.
                The example starts by setting
                two variables:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            pass to hold the pass mark
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            score to hold the users score
                        </li>
                        

                    </ul>

                    To see if the user has passed,
                    a comparison operator checks
                    whether scor e is greater than or
                    equal to pass. The result will be
                    true or false, and is stored in
                    a variable called has Passed. On
                    the next line, the result is written
                    to the screen. 
                    The last two lines select the
element whose id attribute
has a value of answer, and then
updates its contents. You will
learn more about this technique
in the next chapter.

                        <h2>
                            Logical Operators

                        </h2>
                    </p>
                    Here is an example of awhil e
                    loop. It writes out the 5 times
                    table. Each time the loop is run,
                    another calculation is written
                    into the variable called msg.
                    This loop will continue to run
                    for as long as the condition in
                    the parentheses is true. That
                    condition is a counter indicating
                    that, as long as the variable
                    i remains less than 10, the
                    statements in the subsequent
                    code block should run.
                    Inside the code block there are
                    two statements:
                    The first statement uses the+=
                    operator, which is used to add
                    new content to the msg variable.
                    Each time the loop runs, a new
                    calculation and line break is
                    added to the end of the message
                    being stored in it. So+" works as
                    a shorthand for writing:
                    msg = msg + 'new msg'
                    (See bottom of the next page for
                    a breakdown of this statement.)
                    The second statement
                    increments the counter variable
                    by one. (This is done inside
                    the loop rather than with the
                    condition.)
                    When the loop has finished, the
                    interpreter goes to the next line
                    of code, which writes the msg
                    variable to the page.
